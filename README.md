This project is a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not based on certain medical parameters.

## 🚀 Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a prediction system that helps in early detection of diabetes using supervised learning techniques.

We used the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** for training the model.
